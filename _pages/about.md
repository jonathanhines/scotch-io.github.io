I'm a full stack web developer in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.  Building new things get's me up in the morning and I've been in trouble with my wife on occasion when I get too excited about a project and forget about other things like cleaning and eating.

If you have something that you think would be interesting to work with me on, drop me a line.  I can be reached at:
