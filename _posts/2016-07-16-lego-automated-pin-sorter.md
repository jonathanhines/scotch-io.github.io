I just found this post on youtube, google used it's deep learning voodoo to recommend it to me and it seems they chose well.  The video is great, it gets right to the point and require no [Wadsworth constant](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-wadsworth-constant "Wadsworth Constant explained") correction.

This is the first time I've seen a compressed air system for lego and it's a pretty exciting concept.  The system uses 4 pumps, driven off a camshaft to maintain air pressure.  The pressurized air is then used to blow pins into their appropriate bins.  Using only a single optical sensor and a single mind storms brain the machine is able to sort pins into bins automatically.

This makes me want to go out and buy some lego.
